# Portfolio webpage - First year frontend development study at Noroff

A personal portfolio webpage that lists the 3 Noroff projects as cards. These cards have a screenshot of the project and a link to the GitHub repo and pages.The site should be responsive across screen sizes and follow WCAG principles.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- [Bootstrap v.5.2.3](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [SASS/SCSS v.1.62.0](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Prettier v.3.0.3](https://prettier.io/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo through github website or CLI command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Gronnfrosk/portfolio1.git
```

2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Compile your Sass to CSS

You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. In this project use CLI command:

```
"sass --watch src/scss:dist/css & live-server"
```

You can also run the command:

```
npm run start
```

## Github Action Workflow

The project is configured to run action to build and deploy to GitHub pages on 'main' branch push or pull request.
